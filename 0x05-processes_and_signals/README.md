# 0x05. Processes and Signals

This directory contains Bash scripts that demonstrate how to manage Linux processes and signals.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how processes work in Linux.
- Retrieve and interpret process IDs (PIDs).
- Use `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `killall`, `pkill`, `jobs`, `fg`, and `bg`.
- Start processes in the background and bring them to the foreground.
- Send and handle signals like SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL.
